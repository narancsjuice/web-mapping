<h1>Web-Mapping Project</h1>

**Preview 0.1**

The goal of this project was to learn the basics of the Folium Library. The end
result is a web-based application that is capable of asking the user for input of
coordinates for the starting location, generating a world map, and using .csv and 
.json files to produce the map and its layers.

The layers are:
<ul>
<li>Cities of Hungary with population above 10000 (from .csv data)</li>
<li>Volcanoes in eastern North America with elevation levels (from .csv data)</li>
<li>Color-coded countries based with population conditionals (from .json data)</li>
</ul>

The application is based on Python 3.10 and uses the Folium library for the map
visualization.

**Known issues**
<ul>
<li>Refactoring needed for better readability</li>
</ul>
